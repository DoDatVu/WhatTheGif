# WhatTheGif


When the user clicks on a button, the page will render 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

Under every gif, it will display its rating (PG, G, so on).

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
Users are allowed to add onto the buttons using the form to input what gis they want to search
